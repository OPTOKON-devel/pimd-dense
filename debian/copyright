Comment: pimd-dense is built on top of an older version of pimd (sparse),
         so the default/fallback license for all files are the same as pimd.
	 In many cases the previous Oregon license has been reverted back to
	 the USC since most of the code from pimd has been grafted onto pimdd
	 by Joachim Wiberg during the reconstruction effort.  The wonderful
	 mix with the mrouted code base makes it hard to see the difference,
	 but most of the configuration, main, and DVMRP specific code is all
	 that remains of the mrouted code base.   The pimd-dense specifics
	 are centered around the PIM source files.
